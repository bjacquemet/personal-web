```

## Sidebar

The sidebar header is defined within the `params.intro` section. The `main` being the top header and `sub` the subheader

```TOML
[params.intro]
  main = "Hi, I'm Edna :wave:"
  sub = "I'm a Web Developer and Entrepreneur"
```

You can also customize the params with the  `params.sidebar` parameters. The `config.toml` file contains the default values as examples.
```TOML
[params.sidebar]
  backgroundImage = ''
  gradientOverlay = ''
  logo = ''
```

## 404

The 404 page is defined within the `params.notFound` section.
The `gopher`, `h1` and `p` params define the image and texts displayed on the page. 

In the `[params]` section, the `mainSections` params possible values are 'portfolio' or 'post': it defines the section highlighted on the page.

NB: to see the 404 page from your development env, check `/404.html`.

```TOML
[params.notFound]
  gopher = "/images/gopher.png"
  h1 = 'Bummer!'
  p = "It seems that this page doesn't exist."

[params]
  mainSections = ['portfolio']
```

You can also define how the post and portfolio sections will be named on the 404 page, thanks to the `params.sections` params.

```TOML
[params.sections]
  post = "article"
  portfolio = "project"
```

## Customization

You can define a custom CSS file in the `customCSS` param and a favicon.
```TOML
[params.assets]
  favicon = ""
  customCSS = ""
```

## Social

You can define your social media usernames in the `params.social` and the `params.contact` paramaters. 

In this last section, the email expects your email address and the text is what will be displayed on the sidebar, right below the last item of the menu. If blank, nothing is displayed.

```TOML
[params.social]
  github = "https://github.com/"
  twitter = "https://twitter.com/"
  linkedin = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/"
  medium = "https://medium.com/"
  codepen = "https://codepen.io/"
  facebook = "https://www.facebook.com/"
  youtube = "https://www.youtube.com/"
  instagram = "https://www.instagram.com/"
  gitlab = "https://gitlab.com/"
  keybase = "https://keybase.io/"

[params.contact]
  email = ""
  text= ""
```

## Latest Publication
You can define the name of the latest publication header on the home page with the param `latestPublishHeader`.

```TOML
[params.main]
  latestPublishHeader = "My Latest Project"
```
